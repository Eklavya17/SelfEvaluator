The best way to fix it is simply to add a closing parenthesis at the end like so:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n``` \n\nNow, when you run this script, it will output: `Hello World!` as expected."

You can download artwork for some of them even at the Exoplanet Travel Bureau\n# But is there a system like our own Solar system with 8 planets (sorry Pluto)? In fact, there may be at least one - Kepler 90. This along with most other Kepler planets, were not discovered through radial velocity measurements like our example in class (i.e. that nice parameteric model doesn't apply), but were rather discovered through transits - dips in the light of the star as the planet moves around it.\n# You get to find 3 exoplanets in the Kepler-90 system with the techniques in class.\n# To get and analyze the Kepler data, you'll need the lightkurve package\n# python -m pip install lightkurve --upgrade\n# I've included some code to get the light curve, clean it and remove the NaNs, and some outliers (you can judge the wisdom of strong outlier removal when you are hunting for planets), and bin the light curve a little bit in time.\n\n# Hints:\n# * lightkurve has a bunch of useful tutorials, in particular this one\n# * once you get to a periodogram with lightkurve, find_peaks in scipy can help identify the exoplanet peaks\n# * You might find it easier to remove the signal of each planet as you find it and work with the residual light curve to find the next. This isn't strictly necessary if you do the previous steps well, but can be helpful. The tutorials page has a demo.\n# * The Exoplanet Archive might be of help\n\n# Happy (planet) hunting!\n\n# import numpy as np\n# import astropy.table as at\n# import astropy.units as u\n# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# import lightkurve as lk\n# from scipy.signal import find_peaks, find_peaks_cwt\n\n# ### RUN THIS\n# lcfs = lk.search_lightcurve('Kepler-90', mission='Kepler').download_all()[:12]\n\n# ### RUN THIS\n# def squelch_rednoise(lc):\n#     corrected_lc = lc.remove_outliers(sigma_upper=10, sigma_lower=10).normalize().flatten(window_length=101)\n#     return corrected_lc\n\n# ### RUN THIS - it will take a while.\n# stitched_lc = lcfs.stitch(corrector_func=squelch_rednoise)\n\n# clc = stitched_lc.remove_nans().bin(time_bin_size=15*u.min)\n# clc.scatter();\n# Q1. First, calculate the periodogram using lightkurve. Use the bls method. Look for planets between 50 and 500 day periods with a grid spacing of 0.01d - this is coarse. Use scipy.signal.find_peaks to identify peaks in the periodogram. Remember to exclude any peaks arising from the Earth's revolution. Plot the periodogram and highlight the peak locations.

In fact, there may be at least one - Kepler 90.

You can download artwork for some of them even at the Exoplanet Travel Bureau\n# But is there a system like our own Solar system with 8 planets (sorry Pluto)? In fact, there may be at least one - Kepler 90. This along with most other Kepler planets, were not discovered through radial velocity measurements like our example in class (i.e. that nice parameteric model doesn't apply), but were rather discovered through transits - dips in the light of the star as the planet moves around it.\n# You get to find 3 exoplanets in the Kepler-90 system with the techniques in class.\n# To get and analyze the Kepler data, you'll need the lightkurve package\n# python -m pip install lightkurve --upgrade\n# I've included some code to get the light curve, clean it and remove the NaNs, and some outliers (you can judge the wisdom of strong outlier removal when you are hunting for planets), and bin the light curve a little bit in time.\n\n# Hints:\n# * lightkurve has a bunch of useful tutorials, in particular this one\n# * once you get to a periodogram with lightkurve, find_peaks in scipy can help identify the exoplanet peaks\n# * You might find it easier to remove the signal of each planet as you find it and work with the residual light curve to find the next. This isn't strictly necessary if you do the previous steps well, but can be helpful. The tutorials page has a demo.\n# * The Exoplanet Archive might be of help\n\n# Happy (planet) hunting!\n\n# import numpy as np\n# import astropy.table as at\n# import astropy.units as u\n# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# import lightkurve as lk\n# from scipy.signal import find_peaks, find_peaks_cwt\n\n# ### RUN THIS\n# lcfs = lk.search_lightcurve('Kepler-90', mission='Kepler').download_all()[:12]\n\n# ### RUN THIS\n# def squelch_rednoise(lc):\n#     corrected_lc = lc.remove_outliers(sigma_upper=10, sigma_lower=10).normalize().flatten(window_length=101)\n#     return corrected_lc\n\n# ### RUN THIS - it will take a while.\n# stitched_lc = lcfs.stitch(corrector_func=squelch_rednoise)\n\n# clc = stitched_lc.remove_nans().bin(time_bin_size=15*u.min)\n# clc.scatter();\n# Q1. First, calculate the periodogram using lightkurve. Use the bls method. Look for planets between 50 and 500 day periods with a grid spacing of 0.01d - this is coarse. Use scipy.signal.find_peaks to identify peaks in the periodogram. Remember to exclude any peaks arising from the Earth's revolution. Plot the periodogram and highlight the peak locations. (25 pts)\n# Q2. a. The periodogram function from lightkurve can also get a transit time and peak power using periodogram.transit_time and periodogram.power - you'll want both. Get a sorted list of candidate periods, and print it sorted by peak power. (10 pts)\n# Q2. b. Next sort the list of periods from longest to shorted. Check if each period has a period in your list that is either 1/2 or 1/3 the same value. If it is, exclude it. If not keep it. Select the four periods with the highest power between 0 to 100d, 100d and 200d, 200d and 300d and 300d and 400d. (15 pts)\n# Q3. Select each peak period from the coarse grid in Q2.b. and then use lightkurve algorithm to refine the period within +/- 5 days, and get the best period. (25 pts)\n\n# Q4. Use lightkurve.fold to plot the folded light curve for each of the best periods in Q3. (25 pts)",

        "Response": "Apologies for the confusion earlier. The error message indicates that the period range used to create the periodogram is too large, resulting in a large number of points in the periodogram. A larger `frequency_factor` can solve the issue as it will reduce the number of points.\n\n```frequency_factor``` is an optional argument for the ```to_periodogram``` method and represents the factor by which to oversample the frequency grid. \n\nBecause the conversion between period and frequency isn't linear, when a period array is passed to the ```to_periodogram``` method, it does an oversampling over the frequency grid. This oversampling might lead to a very large frequency grid, thus taking up a lot of memory and slowing down computation.\n\nLet's update the line that creates the periodogram to:\n\n```python\nbls_periodogram = clc.to_periodogram(method=\"bls\", period = np.arange(0.01, 500, 0.01), frequency_factor=0.1)\n```\n\nThis will significantly reduce the number of points in the periodogram by reducing the oversampling. However, note that reducing oversampling will speed up the operation but might lead to less precise results, as it will sample periods in larger steps.\n\nHere is the updated full code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport astropy.units as u\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport lightkurve as lk\nfrom scipy.signal import find_peaks\n\n# Searching for and downloading the Kepler-90 light curve data\nlcfs = lk.search_lightcurve('Kepler-90', mission='Kepler').download_all()[:12]\n\n# Defining the red noise removal function\ndef squelch_rednoise(lc):\n    corrected_lc = lc.remove_outliers(sigma_upper=10, sigma_lower=10).normalize().flatten(window_length=101)\n    return corrected_lc\n\n# Stitching the light curve data\nstitched_lc = lcfs.stitch(corrector_func=squelch_rednoise)\n\n# Removing NaN values and binning the light curve\nclc = stitched_lc.remove_nans().bin(time_bin_size=15*u.min)\n\n# Removing NaN values\nclc = clc.remove_nans()\n\n# Preparing the periodogram\nbls_periodogram = clc.to_periodogram(method=\"bls\", period = np.arange(0.01, 500, 0.01), frequency_factor=0.1)\npeaks, _ = find_peaks(bls_periodogram.power, height=0.05)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.plot(bls_periodogram.period, bls_periodogram.power)\nplt.plot(bls_periodogram.period[peaks], bls_periodogram.power[peaks], \"x\")\nplt.title('Periodogram')\nplt.xlabel('Period [days]')\nplt.ylabel('Power')\nplt.show()\n\n# Getting the sorted list of candidate periods\npeak_powers = bls_periodogram.power[peaks].value\npeak_periods = bls_periodogram.period[peaks].value\nbest_periods = sorted(zip(peak_periods, peak_powers), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\nfor period, power in best_periods:\n    print(f\"Period: {period}, Power: {power}\")\n\n# Sorting the list of periods from longest to shortest and checking for fractional periods\nfiltered_periods = []\nfor period, power in sorted(best_periods, reverse=True):\n    half, third = period/2, period/3\n    halves = [p for p, _ in best_periods if np.isclose(p, half, rtol=1e-1)]\n    thirds = [p for p, _ in best_periods if np.isclose(p, third, rtol=1e-1)]\n    if len(halves) == 0 and len(thirds) == 0:\n        filtered_periods.append((period, power))\n\n# Selecting the four periods with the highest power in different ranges\nbest_periods_in_segments = []\nfor lower_bound in range(0, 400, 100):\n    for period, power in filtered_periods:\n        if lower_bound <= period < lower_bound + 100:\n            best_periods_in_segments.append(period)\n            break\n\ndef get_refined_periods(period):\n    grid = np.linspace(period-5, period+5, 5000)\n    periodogram = clc.to_periodogram(method=\"bls\", period=grid)\n    return periodogram.period_at_max_power.value\n\n# Refining the periods\nbest_periods_refined = [get_refined_periods(p) for p in best_periods_in_segments]\n\n# Plotting the folded light curve for each of the best periods\nfor period in best_periods_refined:\n    clc_folded = clc.fold(period)\n    clc_folded.plot()\n```\n\nOnce again, make sure that the 'lightkurve' library is installed in your Python environment before running this script.",
